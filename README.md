## 🏗️ **What is Amazon VPC?**
With **Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)**, you can launch AWS resources in a **logically isolated virtual network** that you define.  
This **virtual network** closely resembles a traditional on-premises network but benefits from the **scalability and flexibility of AWS**.

The following diagram shows an example **VPC architecture**.  
Each **Availability Zone** in the Region contains a **subnet** with EC2 instances, and an **Internet Gateway** allows communication between the VPC and the **internet**.
